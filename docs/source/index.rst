   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Fimbu's documentation!
===================================

**Fimbu** (/fee'mboo/) is a thin functionnal layer over `litestar <https://docs.litestar.dev/>`_ and `edgy ORM <https://edgy.tarsild.io/>`_.
Fimbu isn't a framework; it's just a tool to abstract the **coupling** of Litestar and Edgy ORM. Additionally, it slightly improves developers' **experience**.


.. note::

   This project is under active development.


.. warning::
    Fimbu is a great tool for web developers, but it's not ideal for beginners ðŸ˜ .
    Given that it is based on Litestar and Edgy ORM, you will need to know at least the basics of asynchronous programming and a little good knowledge of how ORMs such as Django ORM or SQLAlchemy work to be really comfortable.

============

Create a new project
********************

.. code-block:: console

    $ fimbu start-project hello


This command creates all project related files in the current directory.
if you want to change the directory give the '-d' or '--directory' option with the directory path.

Project structure
*****************

Fimbu is heavily inspired by Django and some parts of the code were directly adapted from Django.

    | .
    | :file:`Hello`
    |   â”œâ”€â”€ :file:`main.py`
    |   â””â”€â”€ :file:`settings.py`
    | :file:`static`
    | :file:`templates`
    | :file:`fimbu.ini`


**Hello**
   this is the project directory, don't rename it even you can do it. this directory contains two files by default.

**main.py**
   this file contains the entrypoint of the projet, it's where you will the ASGI application.

**settings.py**
   Like django, this is the project settings file.

**static**
   Static files directory

**templates**
   Jinja Templates (default) directory


**fimbu.ini**
    This is the entrypoint for fimbu CLI, it helps to detect if the current directory is a fimbu project.


Create an application
*********************

.. code-block:: console

    $ fimbu start-app hello_app

This command creates a new application in the current directory.
if you want to change the directory give the '-d' or '--directory' option with the directory path.

.. important::
    ADD Application to the INSTALLED_APPS list in the settings file.

Application structure
*********************

    | apps.py
    | endpoints.py
    | models.py
    | tests.py


**apps.py**
    Application config file.

**endpoints**
    This file contains the routes of your application.

**models.py**
    Models for your application, but you can your models every you want, edgy will find them.

**tests.py**
    Put here your tests.


if you installed your app in the settings file. Now run like this:

.. code-block:: console

Happy coding ! ðŸ˜‚
